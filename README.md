Project Description:
Password Manager

The goal of this project is to develop a secure password manager that allows users to store and retrieve their passwords for different accounts. The password manager will be implemented using Java and can be either a command-line or GUI-based application. The passwords will be encrypted and securely stored to ensure the safety and privacy of the user's sensitive information.

Requirements:
User Registration:
The application should provide a user registration feature where new users can create an account by providing a username and a master password. The master password will be used to encrypt and decrypt the stored passwords.

User Login:
Once registered, users should be able to log in to the password manager using their username and master password combination.

Password Storage:
The application should allow users to store passwords for their various accounts. Each stored password should be associated with a label or identifier to indicate the account it belongs to (e.g., ""Gmail,"" ""Facebook,"" ""Bank Account,"" etc.). The passwords should be encrypted before being stored in the application's database or file system.

Password Retrieval:
Users should be able to retrieve their stored passwords by providing the associated account label or identifier. The application should decrypt the password and display it to the user.

Password Generation:
The password manager should provide a feature to generate strong and secure passwords. The user can specify the desired length and complexity of the password (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters) and the application will generate a random password that meets the criteria.

Encryption:
The passwords stored in the application should be encrypted using a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). The encryption key should be derived from the user's master password.

Security Measures:
The application should implement security measures to protect against potential threats, such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and password guessing. This can include techniques like password salting, hashing, and enforcing strong password policies.

User Interface:
If a GUI-based application is chosen, the user interface should be intuitive and easy to use. It should provide clear options for registration, login, password storage, retrieval, and password generation.

Error Handling:
The application should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user in case of incorrect login credentials, database/file access issues, or other potential errors.

Testing:
Thoroughly test the application to ensure its functionality, security, and usability. Write test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases, such as handling incorrect passwords, testing encryption and decryption, and validating password generation.

Documentation:
Provide clear and comprehensive documentation that explains the application's features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any additional information required for users to understand and utilize the password manager effectively.

Optional Enhancements:
Password Strength Analysis:
Implement a feature that analyzes the strength of the user's passwords based on factors like length, complexity, and common patterns. Provide suggestions for improving weak passwords.

Two-Factor Authentication:
Add an additional layer of security by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA), such as using SMS codes or authenticator apps.

Cloud Sync:
Implement the ability to sync encrypted password data securely across multiple devices using cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.

Password Expiry and Renewal:
Allow users to set an expiration period for their stored passwords. Prompt users to renew their passwords periodically for improved security.

Remember to adhere to secure coding practices throughout the development process to minimize vulnerabilities and ensure the highest level of data protection.
Good luck with your project!"
